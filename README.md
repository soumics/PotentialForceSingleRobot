# PotentialForceSingleRobot

This Matlab Code is intended to give an exposure to potential-force based local planner for single robot. Potential-force based methods are subjected to get "trapped" / immobilized into a "Local Minima" [where the attractive force and the net repulsive force areequal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the net resultant force being zero].
